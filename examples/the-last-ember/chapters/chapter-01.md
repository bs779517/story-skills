The grove was quieter than it should have been.

Sera stood barefoot on the moss, her toes curled against the warmth that seeped up from the ember veins beneath the soil. She'd come to the Heart Grove every morning for twelve years, and every morning the hum had been there — deep and steady, like the earth itself breathing. Today it stuttered.

She pressed her palms flat against the nearest ash tree. Its bark was warm, faintly luminous in the pre-dawn grey, but the glow pulsed unevenly. Weak. Like a heartbeat losing rhythm.

"You feel it too," she murmured.

The tree didn't answer. Trees didn't, no matter what the Vale hermits claimed. But the ember motes that usually drifted between the branches — small points of amber light, lazy and aimless — were fewer this morning. She counted seven. A month ago there'd been dozens.

She pulled her hand back and studied her fingers. The faint amber glow beneath her skin was still there, but dimmer. Everything was dimmer.

A branch cracked behind her. She didn't turn.

"You walk like a drunk ox," she said.

"And you stand in clearings like a target." Kael emerged from the tree line, pulling leaves from his hair. He was mud-spattered from the knees down, his pack slung low, and there were circles under his eyes that hadn't been there three days ago. "Miss me?"

"I noticed it was quieter."

He dropped his pack and sat on the root-knotted ground with a grunt. "The citadel's worse than I thought."

Sera turned then. Kael's face was drawn, the easy humour she'd expected not quite reaching his eyes. He pulled a strip of dried meat from his pack and chewed mechanically.

"How much worse?"

"Double patrols on the outer walls. Maren's brought in soldiers from the southern garrisons — not locals, professionals. There's something new on the east tower, some kind of mounted—" He waved his hand. "Siege thing. Ballista. Big."

"He's expecting trouble."

"He's expecting *you*." Kael looked up at her. "Word's got out, Sera. Someone in the lower warrens has been talking about the Lost Heir. Maren's people are jumpy."

She felt something tighten in her chest — not fear, something hungrier. "Good."

"That's not good. That's the opposite of good." Kael stood, brushing dirt from his trousers. "Jumpy soldiers shoot first. Jumpy soldiers search the mountain passes. We've stayed hidden for twelve years because nobody was looking. Now they're looking."

"Then we stop hiding."

The words came out harder than she intended. Kael flinched — barely, a twitch at the corner of his mouth — and she felt a flicker of guilt that she pushed down immediately. Guilt was a luxury. Time was running out.

She gestured at the grove around them. "Count the embers, Kael."

He looked. His face changed.

"Seven," he said quietly. "There were—"

"Dozens. Weeks ago." She stepped closer to him, lowering her voice even though there was no one to hear. "The Vale is dying. The embers are dying. If we wait for the perfect moment, there won't be any embers left to fight with."

"And if we go now, with double patrols and siege weapons and professional soldiers, we die in a ditch outside the walls." His voice was steady but his hands weren't. "Sera. We need a plan. A real one. Not just—" He gestured at her, at the fading grove, at everything. "Not just *fury*."

She almost argued. The heat was right there, banked behind her ribs, ready to flare. But Kael's eyes were bright with something that wasn't anger, and she remembered — as she had to keep reminding herself — that he'd been twelve when the world ended. Twelve, and dragging her through tunnels while she screamed.

"A plan," she said. "Fine."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just don't be slow about it."

He almost smiled. Almost.

She turned back to the grove and saw it — a single ember mote, larger and brighter than the others, drifting between the trees at head height. It moved with purpose, not the aimless wandering of the others. It moved toward her.

She held out her hand.

"Sera—"

"Quiet."

The ember settled into her palm. It was warm — not hot, not burning, just *warm* — and for a moment the grove was silent. Then the warmth rushed up her arm, through her shoulder, into her chest, and the world snapped into sharp focus. She could feel the veins beneath the soil, the ember-stone threaded through the mountain, the vast slow pulse of something ancient and tired deep below. And she could feel it fading.

The amber glow beneath her skin brightened. At her temples, a strand of dark hair turned grey.

"Sera." Kael's voice was very careful. "Your eyes."

She blinked. The world settled back to normal — duller, smaller, ordinary. But the warmth stayed, curled behind her heart like a sleeping thing.

"I'm fine."

"You sound like him. You know that?"

She looked at her brother sharply. "Like who?"

But she knew. And from the way Kael didn't answer, holding her gaze with that quiet, stubborn grief of his, they both knew.

She closed her fist over the fading glow in her palm.

"We move at first light tomorrow," she said. "Scout me a route that avoids the eastern passes."

"And the plan?"

"The plan is we go back. The plan is we take what's ours. The plan is we don't die." She paused. "In that order."

Kael shouldered his pack. "For the record, I think this plan is terrible."

"Noted."

"I'm still coming."

"I know."

He disappeared into the tree line, quieter this time — when he tried, he could move like smoke through the undergrowth. She listened until she couldn't hear him anymore, then turned back to the grove.

Six embers now. The one she'd absorbed was gone from the air, alive inside her instead. She could feel it — a small, bright defiance against the fading.

It wasn't enough. It wasn't close to enough.

But it was a start.
