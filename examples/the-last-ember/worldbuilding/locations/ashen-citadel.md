# The Ashen Citadel

## Description

A massive fortress-city carved into the face of Mount Kethara, the Ashen Citadel rises from the rock like a blackened crown. Its walls are dark basalt, streaked with veins of ember-stone that once glowed with perpetual warmth. Now the glow is faint and intermittent — a dying heartbeat. The city cascades down the mountainside in tiers: the High Keep at the summit where Lord Maren rules, the Middle Ring of merchant halls and barracks, and the Lower Warrens where common folk live in the shadow of the mountain.

The air smells of old smoke and cold stone. In winter, frost creeps up the walls where ember-heat once kept them warm.

## History

Built by the first Voss monarchs three centuries ago, the citadel was designed around a natural ember well — a fissure in the mountain where raw magical energy surfaced. The Voss family channelled this power to heat the city, light its halls, and fuel the ember magic that protected the Northern Reach. Under their rule, the citadel was a beacon — warm, prosperous, and open.

When Lord Maren seized power twelve years ago, he sealed the ember well, fearing its power could be used against him. The city has grown colder since, both literally and figuratively.

## Culture & Customs

Under the Voss rule, the citadel celebrated the Festival of Embers each winter solstice — a week of fire-lighting and storytelling. Maren banned it. The people still mark the date quietly, lighting small candles in windows when the guards aren't watching.

The citadel operates under martial law. Curfews are enforced, gatherings of more than six are prohibited, and ember magic is outlawed for all but Maren's sanctioned practitioners.

## Notable Features

- **The Ember Well** — sealed beneath the High Keep, once the source of the city's power
- **The Blackened Throne** — the seat of rule, scorched by centuries of ember magic
- **The Whisper Gate** — a hidden passage known only to the Voss bloodline, connecting the High Keep to the mountain tunnels

## Current State

The city endures but doesn't thrive. Trade has dwindled as Maren's paranoia has closed borders. The ember-stone in the walls fades a little more each year. The people are quiet, obedient, and hungry for change they don't dare speak of.
