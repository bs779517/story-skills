# The Whispering Vale

## Description

A deep, mist-filled valley hidden in the mountains east of the Ashen Citadel. Ancient trees — iron-barked ash and silver birch — grow in dense groves, their roots tangled over exposed ember-stone. The forest hums. Not with sound exactly, but with a vibration felt in the chest, like standing too close to a cathedral bell. Wild embers drift between the trees at dusk — small motes of amber light that gather in clearings and scatter at sudden movement.

The air is warm despite the altitude, heated by ember veins running close to the surface. Moss grows thick, streams run warm, and in the deepest groves the trees themselves glow faintly from within.

## History

The Vale predates the citadel. The first Voss settlers found it and recognised it as a place where the dying god's heart lay closest to the surface. They built the citadel nearby to tap its power, but left the Vale itself untouched — sacred ground. Over centuries, it became a place of pilgrimage for ember practitioners, then a place of exile for those too powerful to live among ordinary people.

When the citadel fell, Sera and Kael fled here. The Vale accepted them.

## Culture & Customs

No permanent settlement exists. The few dozen people who live in the Vale are hermits, outcasts, and wild ember-touched — those whose connection to magic made them unwelcome elsewhere. They live simply, trading with no one, answering to no authority. They tolerated Sera and Kael because the forest did.

There is one unspoken rule: you don't harvest ember-stone from the Vale. You take only what the forest offers freely.

## Notable Features

- **The Heart Grove** — the deepest clearing, where wild embers are densest and the hum is loudest
- **The Warm Streams** — heated by underground ember veins, never freeze even in deep winter
- **The Old Stones** — carved markers from before the Voss dynasty, their inscriptions in a forgotten language

## Current State

The Vale is one of the last places where ember magic thrives naturally. As the embers fade elsewhere, the Vale's power has actually concentrated — drawing the remaining magic inward like a dying star. It is both a refuge and a ticking clock. When the Vale's embers go out, there will be nothing left.
