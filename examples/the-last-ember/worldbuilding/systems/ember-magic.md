# Ember Magic

## Overview

Ember magic draws on the remnants of a dying god's heart, fragmented into countless embers scattered through the earth and air of the Northern Reach. Practitioners absorb these embers into their own bodies, channelling the energy as heat, light, and force. The magic is ancient, intuitive, and deeply personal — no two ember-bearers use it the same way.

At its height, ember magic heated cities, forged unbreakable steel, healed wounds, and shielded the Northern Reach from invasion. Now, with the embers fading, it is a dwindling art practised by a handful of survivors and outlaws.

## Rules & Limitations

**Source:** Embers — fragments of divine energy found in ember-stone, wild ember motes, and (rarely) other living bearers. Embers must be absorbed through physical contact or proximity.

**Cost:** Each use consumes ember energy stored in the bearer's body. Minor uses (warming hands, casting light) are trivial. Major uses (shaping stone, unleashing fire) drain rapidly. Overuse causes physical symptoms: grey hair, amber eyes, tremors, and eventually ember-burn — a condition where the body begins to consume itself.

**Hard limits:**
- Cannot create life or raise the dead
- Cannot affect minds or emotions directly
- Range is limited to line of sight for directed effects
- Cannot be stored in objects permanently (enchantments fade)
- A bearer who burns through all their embers dies

**Affinity:** Some bloodlines carry a natural affinity — the ability to absorb and hold more ember energy with less strain. The Voss bloodline has the strongest known affinity. Those without affinity can still use ember magic, but at much greater cost.

**Corruption:** Prolonged heavy use warps the bearer. Physically, they run hot — feverish, ember-eyed, grey-haired. Mentally, they grow certain, inflexible, and ruthless. The magic amplifies conviction into fanaticism. This is what Sera fears most.

## History

Three centuries ago, the first Voss settlers discovered the ember wells — natural fissures where divine fragments surfaced. They built a civilisation around it. Ember magic was common, taught openly, and woven into daily life. The Voss monarchs served as conduits, channelling the deepest wells to power the citadel and protect the realm.

Lord Maren burned out his own ember affinity during the coup — a deliberate sacrifice to prove he wasn't dependent on the magic he sought to control. He then outlawed ember practice for anyone outside his small circle of sanctioned users.

The embers have been fading for decades, accelerating in the last twelve years. Whether Maren's sealing of the ember well caused this or merely coincided with it is a central mystery.

## Practitioners

- **Sera Voss** — strongest living bearer, Voss bloodline affinity, largely self-taught in the Vale
- **Lord Maren** — formerly powerful, burned out his affinity, relies on sanctioned practitioners
- **The Vale hermits** — wild practitioners with varying degrees of skill, no formal training
- **Maren's sanctioned users** — a small cadre who serve as the citadel's ember-workers under strict control

## Impact on Society

Ember magic defined the Northern Reach. Its decline is felt everywhere:
- Cities grow cold as ember-heated walls fade
- Forges that once produced ember-steel now produce ordinary iron
- Healers who once mended bones with a touch now rely on herbs
- The border defences that kept invaders out are failing
- A generation has grown up without magic, and many view it with suspicion rather than wonder

The political divide mirrors the magical one: Maren's faction sees the fading as inevitable and builds a future without magic. Sera's potential return represents the old way — ember-powered, Voss-led, and (to Maren's supporters) dangerously nostalgic.
