# Sera's Reclamation

## Setup

Sera and Kael have survived twelve years in the Whispering Vale. The embers are fading — even in the Vale, the wild motes grow dimmer each season. Sera knows that if she doesn't act soon, there won't be enough ember power left to challenge Maren. She returns to the edge of the Northern Reach, drawn by both vengeance and a deeper pull she doesn't yet understand.

## Rising Action

Sera gathers information, allies, and ember power. She discovers the ember well beneath the citadel isn't just sealed — it's being drained. Maren is siphoning the last of its energy for something. Each ember Sera absorbs makes her stronger but pushes her closer to corruption. Kael watches the change with growing alarm. The siblings' relationship strains as Sera becomes more driven and less cautious.

## Climax

Sera infiltrates the citadel through the Whisper Gate. She confronts Maren in the High Keep and discovers what he's been building: a last defence against the border threats he's always warned about. He wasn't hoarding power for himself — he was trying to protect the realm the only way he knew how. Sera must choose: destroy Maren and seize the remaining embers for herself, or find another way.

## Resolution

Sera chooses to unseal the ember well and release its power back into the land rather than claim it. The embers scatter — weaker individually but spread across the Northern Reach, reigniting the dying magic in a thousand small ways. Maren falls not to violence but to irrelevance. Sera takes the throne not as the Ember Queen but as something new.
