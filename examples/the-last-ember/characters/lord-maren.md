# Lord Maren

## Appearance

Broad-shouldered and imposing, with iron-grey hair cropped close to the skull. His face is hard angles — a broken nose, deep-set eyes, a jaw like a fortress wall. His left hand is blackened and withered, the price of burning out his own ember affinity years ago. He compensates with authority and presence, filling every room he enters. Wears austere black with a single ember-red clasp at his throat.

## Personality & Traits

Coldly pragmatic, genuinely believes his rule is necessary. Maren isn't cruel for cruelty's sake — he's cruel because he sees it as efficient. He views the Voss line as weak idealists who let sentiment override governance. Respects strength and competence, even in enemies. Beneath the iron control, there's a thread of paranoia — he knows the embers are dying and his grip depends on nobody realising how little power he actually holds.

**Strengths:** Strategic brilliance, political instinct, commands absolute loyalty through fear and competence
**Flaws:** Paranoia, inability to trust, confuses control with strength

## Backstory

Once a trusted general of King Aldric Voss. Maren watched the Voss family pour ember magic into the land while the Northern Reach's enemies gathered. He warned them. They didn't listen. When the border wars came, Maren concluded the Voss approach — generous, magical, idealistic — would destroy everyone. He staged the coup believing he was saving the realm. Twelve years later, he's not sure he was wrong, but the cost haunts him more than he'll admit.

## Motivations & Goals

**Primary:** Maintain control of the Northern Reach at all costs
**Secondary:** Eliminate the Voss heirs before they destabilise his rule
**Internal:** Justify the coup — prove his way was the only way
**Fear:** That he destroyed something irreplaceable and it was all for nothing

## Voice & Speech Patterns

Precise and measured. Every word chosen for effect. Rarely speaks more than necessary. Uses silence as a weapon — long pauses that force others to fill the gap. When truly angry, his voice drops rather than rises. Occasionally surfaces a dry, bleak wit that surprises his subordinates.

> "I didn't kill a king to build a democracy. I killed a king to build a wall."

> "The girl survived. That's inconvenient. Not unexpected."

## Character Arc

**Starting state:** Secure in his power and his justification for the coup
**Midpoint:** Sera's return forces him to confront what he destroyed
**End state:** Either breaks under the weight of his choices or doubles down into tyranny
