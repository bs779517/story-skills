# Sera Voss

## Appearance

Tall and lean, hardened by years of survival in the wilds. Dark hair streaked with premature grey at the temples — a mark of ember exposure. Her eyes carry a faint amber glow that intensifies when she draws on magic. A long scar runs from her left jaw to her collarbone, a reminder of the night the citadel fell. She wears practical leathers and a worn cloak, nothing that marks her as royalty.

## Personality & Traits

Fiercely determined but guarded. Sera leads with action, not words, and trusts slowly after years of betrayal. She carries deep anger beneath a controlled exterior — anger at Maren, at the nobles who did nothing, at herself for surviving when her parents didn't. She has a dry, cutting sense of humour that surfaces in moments of stress. Loyal to a fault once trust is earned, but unforgiving when it's broken.

**Strengths:** Tactical mind, ember magic affinity, physical resilience, inspires loyalty
**Flaws:** Struggles to ask for help, prone to self-sacrifice, tempted by vengeance over justice

## Backstory

Born heir to the Ashen Citadel, Sera was raised in the traditions of ember magic by her mother, Queen Elara. At age 16, Lord Maren led a coup — her parents were killed, the citadel seized, and Sera barely escaped with Kael into the Whispering Vale. For twelve years she survived in the wilds, honing her magic and waiting for the right moment to return.

## Motivations & Goals

**Primary:** Reclaim the Ashen Citadel and avenge her parents
**Secondary:** Protect Kael — her only remaining family
**Internal:** Prove she's worthy of the crown without becoming the tyrant Maren is
**Fear:** That using the embers will corrupt her as power corrupted Maren

## Voice & Speech Patterns

Direct and economical with words. Avoids small talk. Uses clipped sentences when stressed, longer reflections when she trusts the listener. Rarely raises her voice — her anger goes quiet, not loud. Occasional dry observations that catch people off guard.

> "I didn't come back to negotiate. I came back to finish it."

> "You want to know what twelve years in the Vale teaches you? Patience. And how to kill quietly."

## Character Arc

**Starting state:** Consumed by vengeance, defines herself by what was taken
**Midpoint:** Begins to see that reclamation requires building, not just destroying
**End state:** Chooses to save the people over punishing Maren, redefines what the crown means
