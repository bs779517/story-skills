# Kael Voss

## Appearance

Shorter and stockier than his sister, with the same dark hair but no grey — he has no ember affinity. Quick, watchful eyes that miss nothing. Moves with a hunter's quiet economy. Dresses in muted greens and browns, blending into forest and shadow. A network of small scars on his hands from years of trap-setting and blade work.

## Personality & Traits

Where Sera is fire, Kael is patience. He's the planner, the one who maps escape routes before entering a room. More emotionally open than his sister — he remembers their parents with grief rather than rage. He carries guilt for not being able to protect them, channelled into an almost obsessive protectiveness of Sera. Pragmatic and resourceful, with a warm streak he tries to hide behind sarcasm.

**Strengths:** Stealth, tracking, practical intelligence, emotional anchor for Sera
**Flaws:** Overprotective, avoids confrontation, doubts his own worth without magic

## Backstory

The second child, never expected to inherit. Kael was 12 when the citadel fell. He remembers less of their parents but more of the escape — dragging Sera through the tunnels while she screamed. He became her protector in the Vale, learning to hunt, scout, and survive while she honed her magic.

## Motivations & Goals

**Primary:** Keep Sera alive through whatever comes next
**Secondary:** Find a life beyond being his sister's shadow
**Internal:** Prove his worth isn't measured by magic
**Fear:** That Sera's quest will get them both killed

## Voice & Speech Patterns

Warmer and more conversational than Sera. Uses humour to deflect tension. Asks questions rather than making demands. Speaks more freely about feelings, though he wraps them in understatement. His voice tightens when he's afraid — the only tell he can't control.

> "For the record, I think this plan is terrible. I'm still coming."

> "She doesn't need magic to be terrifying. Trust me."

## Character Arc

**Starting state:** Defines himself through Sera — her protector, her scout, her shadow
**Midpoint:** Forced to act independently, discovers his own leadership
**End state:** Chooses to stand beside Sera as an equal, not behind her as a shield
