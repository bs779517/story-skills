# The Last Ember

## Synopsis

In a world where magic flows from living embers — fragments of a dying god's heart — Sera Voss returns to the Ashen Citadel to reclaim her birthright from Lord Maren, the usurper who murdered her parents and seized control of the Northern Reach. But the embers are fading, and Sera must decide whether to use the last of their power for vengeance or to save the people who forgot her name.

## Tone

Dark and atmospheric with threads of hope. The world feels ancient and worn — stone walls blackened by old fires, forests that whisper with residual magic. Character-driven, with political intrigue woven through personal stakes. Moments of warmth between Sera and Kael contrast with the bleakness of what they've lost.

## Setting

The Northern Reach — a mountainous, forested region ruled from the Ashen Citadel. Once a seat of ember magic, now a fading power under Lord Maren's iron grip. Beyond the citadel lies the Whispering Vale, where the last wild embers still burn in hidden groves.

## Central Conflict

Sera must gather enough ember power to challenge Lord Maren, but each ember she consumes brings her closer to the same corruption that destroyed her family. The magic demands a price, and the price is becoming the thing she hates.
