## 🌐 Understanding Markdown for Writing

Markdown is a simple way to format text using easy symbols. It’s perfect for writers because you don't need complex tools to format your story. Here are some common markdown rules:

- `#` to `######` creates headings from big to small.
- `**bold text**` makes words bold.
- `*italic text*` makes words italic.
- Lists use `-` or `*` followed by space.
- Links use `[text](url)` format.

story-skills shows your markdown as formatted text while you write. This helps keep your story neat without special skills.
